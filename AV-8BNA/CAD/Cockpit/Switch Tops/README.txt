Switch top STL files by Bogdan Bosiocic

One thing to bear in mind is that if you screw the Flap switch top onto a switch actuator 
that's already 12 mm long the total actuator length will be over 40 mm long now which is 
quite a bit taller than the real switch in the aircraft. 
I didn't consider that when I made it. It's not perfect and I 
may amend the design but for now I'm gonna see how it works in my cockpit.
